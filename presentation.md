Title: Building Guardrails for Your Data: Ensuring Privacy & Security in AI Applications with Python

Introduction:
As AI continues to revolutionize numerous sectors, it's vital to ensure that sensitive data such as personally identifiable information (PII) and intellectual property (IP) are well-protected. Today, we'll discuss various Python packages and techniques that can help secure our data in the AI era.

Agenda:

1. Introduction to Data Privacy & Security in AI:
    - Overview of challenges
    - Understanding the need for data sanitization and anonymization

2. Building Python Guardrails:
    - html_sanitizer: Removing potential harmful content from user inputs
    - validators: Validating and anonymizing URLs in data
    - Faker: Generating fake data for testing purposes
    - presidio_analyzer: Identifying and anonymizing sensitive entities in text data
    - langdetect: Detecting the language of the input for better processing

3. Building a Sanitization Pipeline in Python:
    - Step-by-step guide to using these packages to sanitize user inputs

4. Opting Out of OpenAI's Retraining Process:
    - Guide to OpenAI's data usage policy
    - How to opt out and protect your data from being used in model training

5. Integrating Python & OpenAI Tools:
    - Ways to incorporate OpenAI's unique tools in everyday tasks
    - Ensuring data security in the process

Materials Provided:
- Example code files for building your own sanitization pipeline
- A detailed guide for the opt-out procedure
- Some exercise files to test your knowledge and implementation

About Me:
As an intern Data Analyst for an ed-tech company engage2Learn, I am seeking to revolutionize modern public schools by providing targeted coaching to educators and supporting them through holistic growth methods. I serve on our Tiger Team for aiOps and am assisting in developing our next AI-integrated platform GroweLab.

Through this presentation, we will explore how Python, along with a suite of robust packages, can help us build effective guardrails to protect sensitive information and ensure privacy while working with AI models.
